# Final-Project
This project is a culmination of all I have learned in my Advanced Programming for Linguists. In this repository you will find resources for Speech Language Pathologists, linguists, and linguistics students. In this portfolio you will find three projects. First, I have made a Speech Calculations App made with Shiny that can perform various speech related calculations like mean length of utterance, number of syllabes and speech rate. Second, I have also created a regex program that counts and prints vowel clusters in words. Third, I have made a Swirl course that teaches the user what Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) is, how to calculate it, and how Speech Language Pathologists increase MLU in children.

Each of the three projects has its own folder, containing code and a README.md with instructions for how to use it.

Before you can run any of the programs, you will have to fork the respository. Here's how you can do that:
1. First, navigate to the GitHub repository. 
2. On the repository page, click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. 
3. Go to R.Studio and click "File" --> "New Project" --> "Version Control".
4. Choose "Git" as the type of version control system.
5. In the "Repository URL" box, paste the URL of the forked repository.
6. Add .git to the URL
7. Choose a directory where you want to save the project on your computer.
8. Click on "Create Project" to create the project.
9. You now have access to all the projects!

Thank you for being here! I hope you'll find something useful to you.
