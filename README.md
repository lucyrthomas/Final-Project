# Final-Project
This project is a culmination of all I have learned in my Advanced Programming for Linguists. In this repository you will find resources for Speech Language Pathologists, linguists, and linguistics students. In this portfolio you will find three projects. First, I have made a Speech Calculations App made with Shiny that can perform various speech related calculations like mean length of utterance, number of syllabes and speech rate. Second, I have also created a regex program that counts and prints vowel clusters in words. Third, I have made a Swirl course that teaches the user what Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) is, how to calculate it, and how Speech Language Pathologists increase MLU in children.

Each of the three projects has its own folder, containing code and a README.md with instructions for how to use it.

Before you can run any of the programs, you will have to fork the respository. Here's how you can do that:
1. First, navigate to the GitHub repository. 
2. On the repository page, click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. 
3. You now have access to all the projects!

Thank you for being here! I hope you'll find something useful to you.

To load a forked repo into RStudio, you can follow these steps:

First, you need to clone the forked repository to your local machine. You can use the command-line interface (CLI) or a Git client like GitHub Desktop to do this. Make sure that you have Git installed on your machine before proceeding.

Once you have the repository cloned to your local machine, open RStudio.

Click on the "File" menu and select "New Project".

In the "New Project" dialog box, select "Version Control".

Choose "Git" as the type of version control system.

In the "Repository URL" field, enter the URL of your forked repository.

Choose a directory where you want to save the project on your local machine.

Click on "Create Project" to create the project.

RStudio will now clone the repository to the directory you specified and open the project.

You can now start working with the project files in RStudio.

Note: Before starting to work with the project, make sure to install any necessary packages or dependencies that are required by the code. You can do this by running the appropriate commands in the R console or by using the "Packages" tab in RStudio.
