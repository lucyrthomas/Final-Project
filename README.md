# Final-Project
This project is a culmination of all I have learned in my Advanced Programming for Linguists. In this repository you will find resources for Speech Language Pathologists, linguists, and linguistics students. In this portfolio you will find a Speech Calculations App made with Shiny that can perform various speech related calculations like mean length of utterance, number of syllabes and speech rate. I have also created a regex program that counts and prints vowel clusters in words. I have also made a Swirl course that teaches the user what Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) is, how to calculate it, and how Speech Language Pathologists increase MLU in children.

Before you can run any of the programs, you will have to fork the respository. Here's how you can do that:
