  Version: 2.4.5

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to this lesson on Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)!

- Class: text
  Output: Today we are going to learn what Mean Length of Utterance is, how to calculate it, and some strategies used by Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to increase MLU.

- Class: text
  Output: Mean Length of Utterance is a measure of how many words a child produces. It is a calculation of the average length of the sentences that a child typically uses. This measure is very useful for Speech Language Pathologists and people studying child language aquisition

- Class: text
  Output: It is calculated by collecting 100 utterances spoken by a child and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of utterances
  
- Class: text
  Output: But first, what is a morpheme?

- Class: text
  Output: A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a word. For example, runs has two morphemes, run and -s.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many morphemes are in the word running?
  CorrectAnswer: 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2)
  Hint: run and -ing
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If in 100 utterances a child uses 300 morphemes, write the expression to calculate the MLU
  CorrectAnswer: 300/100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='300/100')
  Hint: MLU is calculated by collecting 100 utterances spoken by a child and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of utterances

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a short video about increasing MLU in children? I suggest you do, because there will be questions afterwards!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following is not a strategy used by SLPs to increase MLU?
  AnswerChoices: workbook excersises;expanding;pacing strategies;using parts of speech besides nouns
  CorrectAnswer: workbook excersises
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'workbook excersises')
  Hint: workbook excersises

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following best describes expanding?
  AnswerChoices: Adding to what the child says to encourage longer sentences;opening the chid's mouth very wide to make room for words;teaching kids long division
  CorrectAnswer: Adding to what the child says to encourage longer sentences
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Adding to what the child says to encourage longer sentences')
  Hint: Adding to what the child says to encourage longer sentences

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Pacing strategies can rely on any of the following EXCEPT
  AnswerChoices: telling your child to speak more slowly;hand signals that provide visual cues;a sticker board that provides a visual cue
  CorrectAnswer: telling your child to speak more slowly
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'telling your child to speak more slowly')
  Hint: telling your child to speak more slowly

  Output: That's all for this lesson! You should now know more about MLU, how it's calculated, and how SLP's encourage longer sentence lengths in children. Thanks for joining us!
