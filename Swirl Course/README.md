# Description of the Course
This Swirl Course teaches you what Mean Length of Utterance(MLU) is, how to calculate it manually, and how Speech Language Pathologists increase it in children. This program is designed to complement my MLU calculator in the Speech Calculations app by giving users background information on MLU.
