  Output: Welcome to this lesson on Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)!

- Class: text
  Output: Today we are going to learn what Mean Length of Utterance is and how to calculate it.

- Class: text
  Output: Mean Length of Utterance is a measure of how many words a child produces. It is a calculation of the average length of the sentences that a child typically uses.

- Class: text
  Output: It is calculated by collecting 100 utterances spoken by a child and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of utterances
  
- Class: text
  Output: But first, what is a morpheme?

- Class: text
  Output: A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a word. For example, runs has two morphemes, run and -s.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many morphemes are in the word running?
  CorrectAnswer: 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2)
  Hint: run and -ing
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If in 100 utterances a child uses 300 morphemes, write the expression to calculate the MLU
  CorrectAnswer: 300/100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='300/100')
  Hint: MLU is calculated by collecting 100 utterances spoken by a child and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of utterances

- Class: script
  Output: Now we will write a code to calculate MLU for us
